# Keynote: The Way We Think About Change

## Abstract

Change is a core part of the tech industry. As developers, we're always learning and growing. But change can be hard to accept and accomplish, whether it's refactoring a small piece of code, switching to a different framework, or changing the direction of our product or career. In this talk, we'll explore different areas of change we face in the industry and how to navigate them. We'll also talk about strategies for managing and accepting change and seeing them as stepping stones as we grow in our careers.
