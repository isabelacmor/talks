# Navigating the Unfamiliar: Understanding New Codebases

## Abstract

Imagine this: it’s your first day in a new codebase and you’re pumped! You clone your team's repo and start diving one. One file leads to another which leads to another. Before you know it, you're lost and can't figure out how you got there or how to get out.

In this talk, we’ll deep dive into how to navigate unfamiliar codebases, whether your own team's or an open source's. We'll look at tools that will help you orient yourself and talk through techniques so you can learn _how_ to learn. We'll also talk about strategies for understanding the functionality behind unfamiliar code and finding the right help when you need it.
