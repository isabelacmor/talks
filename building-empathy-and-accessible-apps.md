# Building empathy and accessible apps

## Abstract

Everyone knows accessibility is important, but even with the best of intentions, we still might not be achieving an accessible design in our apps. In this talk, I'll help the audience build their empathy for disabled users through the eyes of someone in the disabled community (myself), while giving them the tools they need to tackle accessibility both from a design and implementation standpoint.

Level: Beginner

Length: 30 min session

## Description

### Objectives

- Provide an overview on common areas to tackle for accessibility
- Provide a recommendation on tools that both designers and developers can use to test that their products are accessible

This talk can be given in two formats:

- 10 minute lightning talk. This format will give a more high-level overview on tools I've found helpful when checking my products and features for accessibility.
- 30 minute session. This format will dive deeper into what areas developers and designers should focus on for accessibility reviews and common things that are overlooked. It will then cover useful tooling for each scenario and a brief run through of how to use them.

The goal of this talk for developers and designers alike to leave feeling better equipped to design and test for accessibility and have a better set of tools to approach these problems with.
