# Speaker rider

Before I'll agree to speaking at a conference, meetup, or event, I do as much research as possible to ensure that it aligns with my goals of inclusion, diversity, and accessibility in the community.

I acknowledge that speaking is a privilege and I'm grateful to all the conference organizers that have done a wonderful job of hosting me in the past. I want to continue to use this privilege to help shape the tech community into a more inclusive version where everyone can feel safe and represented, regardless of race, gender, or identity.

## Hosting accommodations

### Travel

- I ask that travel to and from the event is provided.
- If the event is in my local city (currently Seattle, WA, USA), I ask that transportation (Lyft, parking, etc) be provided to and from the venue.
- I ask that travel either be booked by the event on my behalf, or that I be reimbursed immediately after booking my own travel. For personal reasons, I'm unable to wait until after the event to be reimbursed, as I prefer to book travel early and cannot have personal funds on hold for months. This also provides a more inclusive model for those who can't front the cost of travel, which is usually under-represented minorities.

### Lodging

- I ask that lodging is provided for the full length of the event, unless the event is in my local city and it's reasonable to travel to and from the venue daily.
- For out of state or international events (outside the US), I ask for at least one full day of lodging before the event so I can properly adjust my schedule and avoid any issues caused by flight delays.
- I ask that lodging either be booked by the event on my behalf, or that I be reimbursed immediately after booking my own travel, for the same reasons as above.

### Speaker honorarium

- I ask for a speaker fee because I value my time (and hope you do too), I have to take time off of work to travel and attend, and because I want to normalize people getting paid for their work (especially underrepresented groups).
- For non-profit events, I may choose to waive this based on ticket pricing, scholarship programs, etc.

### Ticket to full conference

- I ask for a ticket to the full conference as a speaker. I genuinely enjoy listening to the other speakers and engaging with the audience on a smaller, more personal scale between sessions.

## Logistics

### Code of conduct

- The event must be dedicated to inclusion, accessibility, and protecting marginalized and under-represented individuals in the tech community.
- The event must have a Code of Conduct that explicitly calls out inappropriate behavior and defines clear methods for handling these situations should they arise.
- The Code of Conduct should provide at least two reporting methods - both in person and over email / text / form submission to protect the privacy and anonymity of the reporter. Oftentimes, those who feel harmed or threatened at events may not be comfortable with reporting the situation in person. See [JSConfEu](https://2019.jsconf.eu/code-of-conduct/) for an example of a great CoC.

### Accessible space

- All areas of the event should be accessible. This includes, but is not limited to: attendee seating, stage (this prevents speakers from having to self-identify before the event), and social events related to or organized by the event (both within and outside the venue).
- A quiet space should be provided by the event for attendees who need to step away for whatever reason. The quiet space should also be enforced as such (I've seen people use quiet spaces to take conference calls, which defeats the whole purpose of this accommodation).

### Live captioning

- Live captioning is incredibly beneficial to those who are hard of hearing, struggle with attention / focus, or prefer to process written information.

### No white-majority lineups

- This includes the full speaker lineup and any panels. I hope to see diversity across race, gender, disability, and identity.
- Under-represented minorities shouldn't be exclusively invited to speak about their experiences as a URM in tech.

### Gender pronoun identification

- The event should provide some method for attendees to self-identify if they so choose. At a minimum, stickers, pins, or writing space should be available on name tags / badges.

### Scholarship programs

- If you have a scholarship program, call it a "scholarship program" not a "diversity scholarship". The latter implies that diverse (which is usually associated with race) candidates need charity.
- Include travel, otherwise you're limiting yourself to only local attendees, which isn't conducive to creating an inclusive community for those who might live in cities where conferences aren't usually held.

### Stage setup

- The event should provide an accessible stage (see above).
- The event should provide a wireless microphone setup.
- The event should provide a confidence monitor and timer viewable from stage. This allows speakers to see their slides and present fluidly.
- Time slots should be enforced strictly and fairly across all speakers. I've experienced majority speakers who are allowed to go over time, forcing speakers going after them to shorten their content to accommodate.

### Intellectual property

- I allow video recordings and live streams of my content as long as they're accessible and uncensored.
- I'll use whatever my preferred format for slides is at the time (I currently use PowerPoint) and will not use branded slides or templates.
- Speakers should have the option to present from their own computer or from one provided by the event. Providing the hardware needed for a speaker to present (laptop, clicker, etc) is critical for an inclusive experience.

### Remote / virtual events
- I personally prefer live talks rather than pre-recording videos. Pre-recording involves a lot of editing time because of the nature of the medium. If you highly prefer pre-recording, please consider the time commitment with speaker honorariums, or have an editor on your team who can do those edits.
- During talks, please include some sort of moderation of comments (preferably before they go live for the audience to see). Internet trolls unfortunately exist, and have ruined talk playbacks in the past.

## Final thoughts

I appreciate your reading through this and I sincerely hope that nothing included has come as a surprise. Because I closely associate myself with the events I participate in and speak at, my goal is to only attend, speak at, and promote inclusive and accessible events. If there are any concerns with the content of this rider, please contact me directly. As with everything else, this is a work in progress and will evolve as I learn more about myself and speaking.
